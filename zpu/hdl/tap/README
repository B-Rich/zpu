Test Access Port implementation for the ZPU (alpha)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brief:
- Implements JTAG interface (on FPGA custom pins) for the zealot small core.
  Zealot medium (and others) under scrutiny.
- Important: Clock synchronization between TCK and core clock domain has
  to be taken care of by the parenting module, in particular for the
  emuexec_i pin. That means: From the emuexec rising edge signal from the TAP
  you have to create a one core clock cycle wide emuexec_i pulse.
- If you want to swap the debug interface, just write a new tapxxx.vhd
- The software debug interface may change, and it may be different for various
  implementations of the ZPU.
  Possible solution:
  * Create and register various ZPU core IDs (IDCODE instruction)
  * Take care of the ZPU variant in the zpu emulation library:
    $ZPU/zpu/sw/emulation/
  * Likewise, handle various debug interfaces (direct/indirect JTAG, etc.)
  * Implement different debug targets in gdbproxy, callable like
    'gdbproxy zpu_<special_interface_name>', and just use different
    libzpuemu configurations.
