Simple atomic I/O emulation library layer for ZPU [DRAFT]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/2011 Martin Strubel <hackfin@section5.ch>

Brief:
- Supports basic I/O set for debugging
- Depends on a JTAG library defining a few simple commands
- Not yet generic enough
- Should in future take care of different ZPU implementations,
  optimizations and debug interfaces. Currently, it supports the ICEbearPlus
  JTAG library only.
- TBD: Indirect JTAG interface
